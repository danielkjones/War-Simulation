# War Simulation
A python simulation of the card game war.

While playing war with my girlfriend the other day I was curious how long
the average game might last. This is a quick simulation/experiment I am working
on to get an average number of turns, and eventually get an average time.

Considering the current social distancing situation we're in on a global scale,
I figured this might be a good way to pass the time.

Cheers,

Daniel
